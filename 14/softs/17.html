<h3>Unexpected friends</h3>
<h4>Diana Esperanza Pacheco / 2D Animator - Pixel artist</h4>
<p class="sss">A long time ago, there was a village, which used to have earthquakes every day, at the same exact hour. Nobody in the village knew how or why this happened, but no one was interested in finding it out either. They were already used to the earthquakes, living their whole life with them. No explanation was necessary as far as they were concerned. One day a kid, along with his pet, for no particular reason, decided to find out the source of the earthquakes. They walked, and walked, and walked, until they found it. A giant creature that lived among the clouds! The first time they met, the giant suddenly vanished. But the next day the kid and his pet found him again, and the next day, and the next day. Over the time they became friends, and it was at this moment when a wonderful adventure came up to them!</p>
